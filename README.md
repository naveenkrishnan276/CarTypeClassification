Car Type Classification
Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify car types based on various features such as manufacturing indices, interior and exterior attributes, and safety measures. The goal is to create an accurate classifier that can predict the type of a car given its features.

Dataset

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the distribution of features.
Visualized the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant features for model training.
Created new features if necessary.
Model Selection and Training:

Evaluated multiple models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Used hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Selected the best model based on accuracy and other performance metrics.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analyzed the confusion matrix to understand the modelâ€™s performance.
Results
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was selected as the best-performing model. It achieved high accuracy and recall, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying car types. The final confusion matrix is shown below:


Conclusion
This project successfully developed a machine learning model to classify car types with high accuracy. The model can be further improved by incorporating more features and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
